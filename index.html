	<h1>Welcome to Kaiwe.com</h1>
	<p>My name is Steven Oladipo. Ever since I was a young lad I had fascination for literature. My mother used to take me to the library every week or two to check out books to read. While my siblings did not like it, I loved it. It opened up a new world to me. I remeber reading the Hardy Boys mystery novels, Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone, and Gifted Hands by Dr. Ben Carson. These books were the inception of my imagination and the catalysts for my curiosity. Here I wish to share with you all the books that I have read, enjoyed, pondered, loved, hated, and deliberated with friends over. I hope to instill a curiosity in you for the subjects that you enjoy and the things that you would like to learn.<p>
